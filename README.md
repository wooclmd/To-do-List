# React Todo List

A simple and interactive Todo List application built with React.

## Overview

This Todo List application demonstrates how React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, can be used to create dynamic and responsive web applications. It leverages two essential React hooks: `useState` and `useEffect`, to manage and update the application's state and data flow.

## Features

- **Add Todos**: Easily add new tasks to your list by typing in the task and clicking the "Add" button.

- **Complete Todos**: Mark tasks as complete by clicking on the checkbox next to each task. Completed tasks are visually distinguished from uncompleted ones.

- **Filtering**: You can filter your tasks to view only completed or uncompleted tasks. This feature is made possible by the `useState` hook to manage the filter status.

- **Local Storage**: Your task list is persistently stored in your browser's local storage, so even if you refresh the page or come back later, your tasks will still be there.
